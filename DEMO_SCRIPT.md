# Website Content Search - Demo Walkthrough Script

## üé¨ Video Structure (5-10 minutes)

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello! Today I'm going to demonstrate the Website Content Search application I've built. This is a single-page application that allows users to search through any website's content using semantic search technology."

### 1. Application Overview (1 minute)
**Show the main interface:**
- "Here's the main application running at localhost:3000"
- "As you can see, we have a clean, modern interface with two input fields"
- "The first field is for the website URL, and the second is for the search query"
- "There's a search button that will trigger the semantic search"

**Point out key UI elements:**
- "The interface is responsive and works on different screen sizes"
- "We have proper loading states and error handling"
- "The design follows modern UI/UX principles"

### 2. Codebase Structure (2 minutes)
**Navigate to the project structure:**
- "Let me show you the codebase structure"
- "We have a clear separation between frontend and backend"

**Frontend Structure:**
- "The frontend is built with Next.js 14 using the App Router"
- "Here's the main page component that handles the search logic"
- "We have reusable components like SearchForm and ResultCard"
- "The styling is done with Tailwind CSS for a modern look"

**Backend Structure:**
- "The backend is built with FastAPI, a modern Python web framework"
- "Here's the main API endpoint that handles search requests"
- "We have utility modules for HTML fetching, tokenization, and vector storage"
- "The code is well-organized and follows Python best practices"

### 3. Live Demo - Search Workflow (3 minutes)
**Perform a live search:**
- "Now let's see the application in action"
- "I'll search for 'artificial intelligence' on the Wikipedia page"

**Step 1: Input**
- "First, I'll enter the URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"
- "And the search query: artificial intelligence"
- "Now I'll click the search button"

**Step 2: Processing**
- "You can see the loading state while the backend processes the request"
- "The backend is fetching the HTML content, parsing it, and performing semantic search"
- "This typically takes 3-5 seconds for complex pages"

**Step 3: Results**
- "Here are the results! We get the top 10 most relevant content chunks"
- "Each result shows the content chunk, match percentage, and section path"
- "The results are ranked by semantic relevance, not just keyword matching"
- "You can expand each result to see the full HTML context"

**Step 4: Demonstrate Features**
- "Notice how the match percentage is calculated - 70.1% for the most relevant result"
- "The content is properly chunked into 500-token segments"
- "Each result includes the section path for easy navigation"

### 4. Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes)
**Show the backend processing:**
- "Let me show you what happens behind the scenes"
- "The backend fetches the HTML using proper headers to avoid blocking"
- "BeautifulSoup parses the HTML and removes scripts, styles, and other non-content elements"
- "The content is then tokenized into 500-token chunks using NLTK"

**Vector Database:**
- "Weaviate stores the text embeddings for fast semantic search"
- "The sentence transformer model converts text to 384-dimensional vectors"
- "When you search, your query is also converted to a vector"
- "Cosine similarity finds the most relevant chunks"

**API Response:**
- "Here's the API response structure"
- "Each result includes the chunk content, HTML context, path, and relevance scores"
- "The frontend transforms this data for display"

### 5. Error Handling & Edge Cases (1 minute)
**Demonstrate error handling:**
- "Let me show you how the app handles errors gracefully"
- "If I enter an invalid URL, we get a proper error message"
- "If the website is inaccessible, we get a clear explanation"
- "The app continues to work even if the vector database is unavailable"

**Show different scenarios:**
- "Let's try searching for something unrelated to see how the relevance scoring works"
- "Notice how the match percentages are much lower for unrelated content"
- "This demonstrates the semantic search is working correctly"

### 6. Conclusion (30 seconds)
**Wrap up:**
- "In conclusion, this application successfully demonstrates:"
- "Modern web development with Next.js and FastAPI"
- "Semantic search using vector databases"
- "Robust error handling and user experience"
- "All the requirements from the original specification"

**Final thoughts:**
- "The application is production-ready and can be easily deployed"
- "The architecture is scalable and maintainable"
- "Thank you for watching this demonstration!"
